# Recipe-Maker

This app was inspired by my love of cooking/baking, and messy ways of referencing recipes. I created a simple and easy app to create and store recipes.

This is a React application with a mongoDB server.

## How to run the application

 `npm start` will start both the server and open the application in your browser.

## Dependencies

Dependencies for this application include:
    "concurrently": "^4.0.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "mongoose": "^5.4.9",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1"

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
